        <p id="about-me-text">
            My shelves are a reflection of life's winding path - from quantum mechanics textbooks to chronicles of Latin American revolutions. 
            As a physicist and historian, I've amassed a collection that gravitates toward science, philosophy, and political theory, though you'll find plenty of well-worn novels nestled between the heavier texts. 
            What started as a personal library has grown into something I hope to share. 
            While my academic background shapes the core of this collection, I'm eager to expand its horizons through recommendations and exchanges with fellow readers. 
            Think of this as an invitation to browse, borrow, and bring new perspectives to these shelves. 
            After all, the best libraries are built through conversation! <a href="mailto:lvalle14@pratt.edu">Contact me</a> to interact with my collection...
